The company achieves this by purchasing cars, dismantling them, and stocking parts which they can then sell for profit. This project is an e-commerce website designed to facilitate all online activities of the company. While this main activity involves the selling of products online, it also sirves the business and it's users in other ways, such as product-browsing, an online wishlist, and company promotion. The company can easily add all products which they have in stock to the website for customers to browse, and can edit/delete them if needed also. Users have the option to add an item to their "cart" which will show users their currently selected products and offer them an option to checkout and have products delivered to an address. This allows the company to provide an online delivery service of their products, increase exposure of their products/services, and overall increase revenue within the company.

# UX design
## Color scheme
The color scheme chosen for this programme is based on a simple color scheme of Orange and black/navy, with accompany light (usually white) text. The company's logo is also made from a gold/brown gradient, which aims to capture the user's attention and draw focus to the company. This color scheme was chose as it appears to blend aesthetically well with the company's industry of Automobile and stand out enough to draw user attention, whilst at the same time not be overbearing.
Bootstrap is used in the programme so as to easily and efficiently style the various template HTML files. There is also a custom styles.css file to allow for custom styling amongst bootstrap's default files, such as the the brand color of orange used in the logo and hover effects on some buttons.
