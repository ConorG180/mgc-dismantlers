# MGC Dismantlers
MCG Dismantlers are a company which specialise in the sale of second-hand discounted car parts. The company achieves this by purchasing cars, dismantling them, and stocking parts which they can then sell for profit. This project is an e-commerce website designed to facilitate all online activities of the company. While this main activity involves the selling of products online, it also sirves the business and it's users in other ways, such as product-browsing, an online wishlist, and company promotion. The company can easily add all products which they have in stock to the website for customers to browse, and can edit/delete them if needed also. Users have the option to add an item to their "cart" which will show users their currently selected products and offer them an option to checkout and have products delivered to an address. This allows the company to provide an online delivery service of their products, increase exposure of their products/services, and overall increase revenue within the company.
